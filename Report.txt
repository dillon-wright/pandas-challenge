Oberservations, 

1. The first obersavation is that the age breakdown by total spend makes alot of sense whilst 10-18 probbably has the most free time to play games it isn;t until your early 20's that youa ctually have the money to pay for in game items. This is useful to understand because our cutsomers that we should target our efforts on are in the 20-24 age bracket

2. The Second Oberservation is that it is very likley that a player will purcahse a second item with the mean in all age groups over 2 a focus on good customer experance is key to driving repeat buisness.

3. the top purchaser only had 5 purchase's this may suggest that we do not have a broad enough product offering that is relevant or desirable to the players.
